## 1. Project Overview

**Objective:** Develop a secure, scalable, and compliant admin panel with dynamic role-based permissions, multi-payment gateway support, and cryptocurrency management for the KrosChain Wallet project.

---

## 2. Implemented Features

### **Core Functionalities Completed**
- User authentication and login system using JWT and hashed passwords.
- Dynamic role-based permissions (Super Admin, Admin, Manager, Client) with SQL-based configuration.
- Centralized wallet management system with support for multiple wallet types (Funding, Trading, Margin).
- AES encryption for sensitive passkeys and RSA for private keys.
- Gateway integration setup for Stripe, PayPal, Payoneer, and PayNow with modular configurations.

---

## 3. Security and Compliance Review

**Security Implementations:**
- AES-256 encryption for passkeys.
- RSA encryption for private keys with centralized storage.
- Audit logs for critical system actions (user creation, wallet updates, permission changes).
- IP-based geo-blocking with VPN detection.
- Multi-layered permission checks for API access.

**Compliance Notes:**
- GDPR compliance: All sensitive user data is encrypted; PII minimization is practiced.
- PCI DSS: Secure payment transactions through tokenized gateway APIs.
- SOC 2: Robust role-based access control and logging mechanisms.

## 4. Outstanding Tasks and Next Steps

### **1. Permissions & Role Management**
- Review and finalize `permissionsRoutes.js` for dynamic permission assignment.
- Test APIs for updating roles and permissions dynamically.

### **2. Payment Gateway Finalization**
- Finalize and test the APIs for managing Stripe, PayPal, Payoneer, and PayNow.
- Enable admin functionality to dynamically enable or disable gateways.

### **3. Cryptocurrency Management**
- Complete APIs for adding and managing cryptocurrencies with rate limits and API provider details.
- Implement checks for API rate limits and error handling.

### **4. Audit and Logging**
- Expand the `audit_logs` table to capture login details and admin changes.
- Add support for VPN detection logging.

---

## 5. Audit Prioritization and Key Notes
- **Focus Area:** Permission-based security (audit permissions for API endpoints).
- **Secure Configurations:** Ensure proper encryption and storage of payment gateway keys.
- **Scalability:** Implement queuing for API rate limits (especially for large transaction volumes).
